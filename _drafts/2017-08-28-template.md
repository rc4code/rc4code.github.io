This is a template for posts. Any posts should follow this template.

### READ ME

1. Always start with a paragraph of description, as this description would be shown as preview at the front page. If you start with a header, the preview would not display correctly.

2. `authors` and `categories` are arrays, to allow for multiple authors/tags.

3. Do block-quotes as shown below:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  cout << “Hello world.” << endl;  // Here is a comment
  return 0;
}
```
