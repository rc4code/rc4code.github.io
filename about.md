### About rc4code
We at rc4code believe that programming is going to be essential to our future. Therefore, rc4code is set up as a cognitio pod, which aims to provide an avenue for RC4 residents to gain exposure to a variety of programming skills, and to be a place where residents can gather with like-minded people to work on interesting and useful projects. We welcome anyone who are interested in learning programming, including those with no experience, and we strive to make programming an enjoyable and fulfilling experience for everyone!
